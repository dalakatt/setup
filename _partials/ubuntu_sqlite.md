## SQLite

[SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) is a database engine used to execute CRUD commands on databse files. Let's install it with `homebrew` .

In a terminal, execute the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
sqlite3 -version
```


You should see a version. If not, ask a teacher.
