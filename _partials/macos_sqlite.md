## SQLite

[SQLite]https://sqlite.org/index.html is a database engine used to execute CRUD commands on databse files. Let's install it with `homebrew` .

In a terminal, execute the following commands:

```bash
brew install sqlite
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
sqlite3 -v
```


You should see a version. If not, ask a teacher.
